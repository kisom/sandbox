                                    2.   PURPOSE


          The purpose of this standard is to allow transportability of
          FORTH-83 Standard Programs in source form among FORTH-83 Standard
          Systems.  A standard program shall execute equivalently on all
          standard systems.



                                     3.   SCOPE


          This standard shall apply to any FORTH-83 Standard Program
          executing on any FORTH-83 Standard System, provided sufficient
          computer resources (memory, mass storage) are available.
