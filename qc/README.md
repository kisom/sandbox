Experiments in Quantum Computing
================================

Generally, I'm trying to replicate experiemnts using both the
[Microsoft Quantum SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/) and
[pyQuil](http://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

+ msqdk contains the microsoft quantum SDK experiments
+ quil contains the pyquil experiments

Experiments
-----------

+ Bell states: demonstration of simple quantum entanglement,
  superposition, and measurement of qubits.
