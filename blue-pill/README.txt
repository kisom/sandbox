blue-pill:

A small STM32 (Cortex-M0) development board. I bought five dev boards
and a JTAG programmer for sub-$20, and figured I'd mess around with it
and see what happens.

Projects:

+ blinky: the hello, world of software projects
+ draugr: a hardware abstraction layer, due to be renamed
+ skeleton: currently a skeleton for experiments, due to
  be replaced by draugr
+ pins.txt: some useful hookup information
