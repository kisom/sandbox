Exercise 2.4

1. Write statements to copy the array Next into the array Pascal.

   -- Question: is there a 'Length' function call?
   for I in 0 .. 10 loop
       Pascal(I) := Next(I);
   end loop;

2. Write a nested loop to compute all the rows of Pascal's triangle in
   the two-dimensional array Pascal2.

   for Row in 1 .. 10 loop
       Pascal2(Row, 0) := 1
       for Col in 1 .. Row-1 loop
           Pascal2(Row, Col) := Pascal2(Row-1, Col-1) + Pascal2(Row-1, Col);
       end loop;
       Pascal2(Row, Row) = 1;
   end loop;

3. Declare a type Month_Name and then declare a type Date with components
   giving the day, month, and year. Then, declare a variable Today and assign
   Queen Victoria's date of birth to it (or your own).

   type Month_Name is range 1 .. 12;
   type Date is
     record
       Day: Integer; -- maybe restrict to maximum day?
       Month: Month_Name;
       Year: Integer;
     end record;
   Today: Date;
   Today := (Day => 14, Month_Name => 9, Year => 2019);
